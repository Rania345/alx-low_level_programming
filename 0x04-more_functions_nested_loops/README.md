# C - More functions, more nested loops
## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
## Tasks
### Mandatory
0-isupper.c: function that checks for uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c: function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c: function that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c: function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c: function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c: function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line 10 times.

6-print_line.c: function that draws a straight line of length n in the terminal, followed by a new line.

7-print_diagonal.c: function that draws a diagonal line of length n in the terminal.

8-print_square.c: function that prints a square of size n, followed by a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c: prints the numbers from 1 to 100, separated by a space, followed by a new line. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number. For the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10-print_triangle.c: function that prints a triangle of size n, followed by a new line.

### Advanced
100-prime_factor.c: finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

101-print_number.c: function that prints an integer.
